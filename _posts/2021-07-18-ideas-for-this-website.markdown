Sketching the layout
==================
About:
 - Includes an introduction of me
Blog
 - Everything I write about
 - Should maybe be split by topics/subjects. Easy to find content by subheadings.
 - I feel I should focus more on showing what I'm interested in by writing about the topics instead of listing my interests. If someone is interested to know what I'm interested in, they're free to read, and my job is to make the text interesting and easily approachable.
