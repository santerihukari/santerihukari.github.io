More info will be added later, once I have the chance to implement a better documentation for my projects.

Remote controlled bright light
===================
Built with and ESP8266, 230V AC relay, and a couple of LED lights totaling to about 1500 lumen. Currently controlled either via WLAN or telegram bot (also supports timed messages to use it as an alarm)


Telegram bot to announce changes in SportUni gym reservations
===================
Implemented to make finding gym slots easier. Due to corona restrictions, at one point there were very few gym slots available, all of which were reserved within a few minutes of the slots being added to the system.

The bot worked very well, and gave the possibility to reserve canceled slots right away. A lot of positive feedback was given by the users. The bot is now retired due to corona restrictions being eased.
