Hello!

My name is Santeri. I'm an IT student at Hervanta campus of
Tampere University (previously Tampere University of Technology).

I'm interested in projects that have a real effect on the world, no matter if
it's only software or something not related to software at all.

The best way to reach me is by telegram or email, you can begin by introducing
yourself.
