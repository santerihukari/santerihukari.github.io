Hi — this is the personal website of **Santeri Hukari**.

I am finishing a **Master’s degree in Information Technology**, majoring in **Signal Processing and Machine Learning**. My Master’s thesis focuses on **learning-based methods for robotic manipulation**, with particular interest in transformer-style policy models.

A portion of the content on this website is created with assistance from AI tools, primarily for code generation, information gathering, and structural drafting.
